The astounding result of unsupervised transfer learning and the capability of reconstructing highly masked (up to 90%) images might herald a new era in CV. This is a series of paper reading notes, hopefully, to push me to read paper casually and to leave some record of what I've learned. Paper: Masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners Useful link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sq4y1q77t/ NLP CV Supervised Transformer[17] ViT[8] Self-supervised Bert[1] MAE Inspired by Bert[1] and ViT[8], MAE shows the capability of unsupervised learning on CV. It's not the first work to expand Bert [1] to CV, but it might be the most influential one. It might accelerate the application of transformer in CV, as Bert[1] has done with NLP. Notes Title Note the title format, \"Something is a good fellow\", is same as the GPT[2] series. It is a powerful format to include the distilled conclusion in the title. Abstract This paper proposes an asymmetric, transformer-based, denoising auto-encoder architecture. The unsupervised pre-training task is to reconstruct highly masked input images. The high masking ratio is the key. It reduces the pre-training time by 3 times and is able to train larger model efficiently, resulting in competitive reconstructing accuracy. The transfer performance is even better than the supervised pre-training models. Key figures First, the reconstruction results are shown below. Although the details are vague, the reconstruction of the main content is astonishing. Note that maybe not all of the validation images turned out as good as this, but this result is still really surprising. Conclusion The model is said to be simple(false) and scaled well(as long as you are rich). The results show that MAE makes scaleable unsupervised pre-training in CV applicable, a similar route to that of NLP[1][2]. Besides, they claim the semantic difference between text and image leads to different masking operations. Furthermore, they mention that the patch masking operation does not separate semantic entities, meaning one masked patch may include more than one piece of semantic information, unlike language. As a result the reconstruction results show that the model manages to learn from complex semantics. Introduction Although yielding excellent success in NLP, applying scalable unsupervised models in CV is still a challenging problem. But why? i.e. what makes masked autoencoding different between vision and language? 3 reasons are discussed: The architecture difference between convolution and transformer: it's hard to integrate masked embedding or positional embedding to the convolution layer (Actually positional embedding is not needed for convolutional layer) -- addressed by ViT[8]. The information density difference between text and image: Unlike high-semantic text, natural signals in images possess heavy spatial redundancy -- addressed by masking a very high portion of random patches. Decoder difference: in NLP, take BERT as an example, a simple linear projection is used as a decoder, while in vision, a simple decoder is not powerful enough to reconstruct the semantic level information -- addressed by substituting linear projection with transformer layers. Then, the idea of MAE is on the front door. The encoder processes only the unmasked patches, while the lightweight decoder reconstructs the whole image from the encoded latent representation and the [mask] tokens. With a very high masking ratio(e.g. 75%), the pre-training time can be reduced by 3 times. Besides, the data capacity and generalisation performance are great. SOTA accuracy is achieved with fine tuning on a medium-sized dataset (ViT-Huge model on ImageNet 1K). In this section, the reason why designing such an architecture is well presented through Q&amp;A, highly recommended. Sometimes, motive is an important factor in distinguishing a paper from a technical report. Relate work Works in 4 areas are briefly reviewed. Note that BEiT[9] is very similar to MAE, while BEiT[9] projects each patch to a label and predict as Bert[1], unlike projecting to pixels in MAE. Besides, the recently popular constructive methods [14][15][16] relay on data augmentation heavily, while MAE does not. Approach The architecture and the training approach is briefly covered in the sketch below: Additional details about the architecture: For per-processing, non-overlapped patching and random uniform masking are adopted. The [mask] token is shared, and another position embedding is introduced to the decoder input so that the inputs are different on different masked area. But it is unclear whether the positional embedding is performed only on the [mask] token or on the whole input, i.e. encoded patches + [mask] token. Furthermore, the lightweight decoder has &lt;10% computation per token compared with the encoder. Reconstruction target: The decoder aims to recreate the pixels of masked patches. The loss function is the mean squared error (MSE) between the output and the original image, only on the masked region of course. Besides, a variation reconstructing the normalised pixels shows an improvement in representation quality. Implementation: The random masking step is applied by shuffling and dropping the last part. And un-shuffling is used before the decoder to reconstruct the position. In this way, no sparse operation is needed and the cost becomes really low. ImageNet experiments Setup The model is self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K, then evaluated by 2 kinds of supervised training: (i) end-to-end fine-tuning and (ii) linear probing(only the last linear projection layer is allowed to update). ViT-Large (ViT-L/16)[8] is used as baseline backbone. Note that they reproduce the full supervised experiments by ViT[8] and get 8% higher accuracy. The trick is a strong regularisation(75%). May be it meets the previous theory of the semantic difference between picture and text. Supervised, original[8] Supervised, their impl. Self-supervised, Baseline 76.5 82.5 84.9 Ablation Most of the result are recoded clearly on the figures and tables below, Just add some details: Best mask ratio is higher than BERT[1] (15%) and iGPT[7], ViT[8]and BEiT[9] (25%-50%) The encoder manages to learn the semantic representations given that the semantic pieces are mixed in each input patches, different from NLP No saturation of linear probing accuracy is observed, indicating the overfitting is not severer even at epoch 1600 One explanation for (a): a reasonably deep decoder can account for the reconstruction specialisation, leaving the encoder to extract a more abstract latent representation. One explanation for (c): current architecture only process known patches, the introducing of unknown [mask] token would result in a gap between the pre-train task and inference task. Result of (d) indicates that high-frequency components are useful in MAE. And the dVAE token case is actually what BEiT[9] does, projecting each patch to a single token. Result of (e) distinguishes MAE from contrastive learning and related methods. In MAE, the random masking plays the main role of data augmentation. Comparison with unsupervised models: not only the accuracy is better, the pre-training time is shorter than the competitors as well with supervised models: it indicates that MAE can help scale up model sizes. And the MAE performance on ImageNet1K is similar to the model trained on the 300 times bigger dataset JFT300M. But, considering the number of class of JFT300M is much more than ImageNet1K as well, the result is slightly unfair. Partial Fine-tuning In addition to the full fine-tuning and 0 fine-tuning (linear probing), partial ones are applied by fine tuning fixing several layers. The result indicating at least the last 6 layers are task-related. Transfer learning experiments At last, down steam tasks are evaluated compared with other frameworks. Review Writing, simple but has a very good storyline. From the full introduction of the motivation, to the detailed clear figures explaining each part of the design. The algorithm is simple, just applying self-supervised learning to CV based on ViT[8]. 3 points are noted: More patches need to be masked Transformer decoder to reproduce the pixels instead of a simple linear layer projecting patches into tokens. More details to make the model robuster. In conclusion, a simple idea, a great result and detailed experiments make this paper a great work. Reference Devlin, J., Chang, M.

Paper: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale Useful links: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15P4y137jb https://theaisummer.com/vision-transformer/ Not only Vision Transformer (ViT) performs better on traditional CV tasks, it has more impressive properties. As shown above, Naseer et al. demonstrate the tasks where ViT shows extra performance over CNN models, even over humans. Notes Abstract While Transformer-based models such as BERT, GPT series, and T5 nail the NLP tasks, CV tasks remain dominated by CNN-based models. This paper applied a pure transformer encoder (same as BERT) to sequences of cut images and obtains a good classification result, especially with supervised pre-training on a large dataset then fine tuning on a mid-size dataset. Besides, fewer computational resources (meaning 2500 days of TPUv3) are need to attain good results, compared with CNN models. Conclusion Besides the paraphrasing part, the conclusion part discusses the future work based on the ViT. And all of them have follow-up works. Apply ViT to other CV tasks, given the promising performance of DETR. Only 1 and a half month later, ViT-FRCNN and SEDR mange to apply ViT on detection and segmentation respectively. And after 3 months, Swin Transformer introduces hierarchical feature to transformer, making ViT more suitable to vision tasks. Self-supervised pre-training, given the great results of BERT and GPT in the NLP field. Initial explorations in the paper show a gap from the supervised pre-training. One year later, MAE narrows the gap successfully by generative model. Besides, in the section of self-supervised learning, a contrastive learning is mentioned as well, and MOCO v3 and DINO follow this line. Further scaling up this model. Half year later, same group introduces Vit-G with two billion parameters, attaining new SOTA on ImageNet of 90.45%. Introduction Success of Transformer-based models on NLP tasks are firstly reviewed. And it is natural trying to apply such self-attention mechanism to vision. Yet here are one major obstacle: How to transfer a 2D picture to a 1D sequence? One intuitive thought is to flatten the picture directly and treat each pixel as an element. In this way, a medium size 224*224 picture will be converted to a 50,176 long sequence. However, the sequence length is quadratically related to model complexity. Morden hardware only supports input sequence length &lt;1000 of a pure self-attention model. For example BERT only accepts input length of 512. Yet the authors mange to incorporate the original transformer encoder in CV. In order to address the sequence length problem, they split the image into 16*16 patches, each patches denotes a sequence element (token). In this way, a 224*224 image can be converted as a sequence length of 16*16 with each element sized 14*14. Each element then gets linearised through a FC layer before being passed into the transformer encoder. And the afterwards experiments show that the new model doesn't perform well on mid-size model. One explanation is that transformer model lack the image-related inductive bias of CNN (locality and translation equalisation). Yet with pre-training on large dataset such as JFT-300 and ImagNet-21K, a better result than CNN can be approached. Related work It is a detailed related work covering all the aspects in the original paper. I just pick few of them. All the related works aim at reducing the sequence length within the limitation caused by self-attention. Some try to combine CNN with self-attention. For example Wang, X et al.'s work takes the feature map extracted by CNN as the input of transformer. Others try to replace the CNN with a special variation of self-attention. For example, Ramachandran et al.'s work replaces all convolutional sublayers of the ResNet-50 model with self-attention layers. To reduce the computational cost, a local region of the image instead of the whole image is used as the receptive field of the self-attention layer, meaning each pixel only attends to its neighbours in a restricted area. In another work line, Wang, H et.al's work factorising 2D self-attention into two 1D self-attentions to significantly reduce computation complexity. And there is a very similar Cordonnier et al's work also split the images before the self-attention layer. Yet the patch size is 2*2 and with the dataset only CIFAR-10. This paper enlarges the model, apply it in big dataset, and shows the scalability. Another related work image GPT(iGPT) trains a GPT-2 scale generative network. Yet the highest accuracy on ImageNet is 72%, way less than 88% of this paper. But in 2021, an afterwards generative network MAE shows a competitive result of 87.8%, with good transfer leaning capability on segmentation and object detection as well. Besides, works exploring transfer learning performance of CNN model on larger datasets such as ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M are mentioned. And this paper studies the transformer instead of the CNN. Method The whole big idea of the method part is leaving as much as possible the original transformer architecture in order to leverage the good feature and the existing mature efficient implementations of it. Vision Transformer (VIT) From the overview, and the algorithm it should be called Vision BERT instead of Vision Transformer, given the pure encoder architecture and the extra \"classification token\". Assume a 224*224*3 image, after patching, the sequence length is HW/P2=16*16=196 and the width is 14*14*3=768. Given the hidden size of the model D=768, through linear projection layer (E), sequence X [196*768] are multiplied with weight E [768*768]. The resulting linear output [196*768] is then contacted with [cls], followed by adding standard 1D learnable positional embedding to be the transformer input [197*768]. After several transformer blocks, the output size does not change and the [cls] token is projected to a softmax classification layer Ablation experiments The pre and post-processing are crucial for ViT given that the middle transformer encoder layers are kept as original. Multiple rounds of ablation experiments are carried out. Position embedding schemes, 2D embedding and relative embedding are applied to compare with the standard 1D embedding, and no evident gain is spotted. [cls] token vs average pooling, extra [cls] token is inherited from the Transformer model for text, and traditionally in CV, instead of an additional token, an average polling layer after the output layer is usually used as a classifier. The figure blow shows no both works. But in order to stick the original design as close as possible, [cls] token is applied. Another analysis after the model description: Inductive bias: Less locality, translation equivariance and 2D neighbourhood structure are possessed by ViT, compared with CNN. Hybrid Architecture: CNN can be used as a special embedding, leveraging the inductive bias of the CNN model. Limitation on Fine-Tuning Pre-train ViT at larger and higher resolution datasets is proved to be beneficial. Yet the input sequence lengths are different when training on two datasets with different resolutions, resulting in positional embeddings of different lengths. In this article, a 2D interpolation is applied to transfer a pre-trained positional embedding to another dataset to fine-tune. But the accuracy will loss if the resolution difference is too big. Experiments Setup ResNet, ViT, and the hybrid model are evaluated together and ViT wins taking account of the pre-training cost. Besides, a small self-supervision experiment is deployed and sees potential. Two scales of ImageNet(1k and 21k) and JFT(303M) are used as pre-training dataset. Only classification tasks are evaluated with popular datasets. 3 scales of ViT are designed with different patch size(inversely proportional to the amount of data). For example, ViT-L/16 means ViT-Large with 16 patches. Comparison to SOTA And the best results are shown below: Pre-training cost requirements Figure 3 and 4 shows the performance of the presented models on different sizes of per-training datasets. ViT preforms competitive only starts from dataset 21k, and very well only on huge dataset. Figure 5 shows the transfer performances versus pre-training costs on JFT-300M of several models. And it shows that ViT is cheaper than ResNet. Interestingly, the Hybrid model is competitive on low pre-training cost. Inspecting ViT Figure7 Left: The learned linear projection weight matrix E [768*768] is inspected by PCA, and the first 28 components(modes) are visualised as embedding filters. They look pretty much similar to the early layer filters(kernels) of CNN (for example, the first layer of a CNN shown by Brachnmann et.al). This similarity indicates that the linear patch embedding manages to represent the low-dimension structure of each patch. Figure7 mid: Position embedding visualisation first shows that the spatial information is captured well by the E matrix, given that the similarity matrix between patches matches well with the distance relationships of patches. Second, patterns across rows (and columns) have similar representations, indicating the embedding layer has successful learned the row-column relationship. Overall, the 1D positional embedding has learned the 2D structure, coherent with the ablation experiment result. Figure7 Right: The receptive fields of the multi-head attention layers are evaluated by the mean attention distance. Compared with CNN whose receptive field increases linearly with the depth, the ViT attends the whole picture from the first layer, leveraging the natural advantage of transformer. Self-supervision A preliminary exploration on masked patch prediction for self-supervision (mimicking one of the BERT pre-training tasks) has been employed. But the result is not satisfying. And contrastive pre-training are mentioned as a future work. Review This is a concise-written, fundamental article. Just as presented in the conclusion part, it inspired many flow-up works from any direction in the CV area, such as applying to more tasks, changing the architecture(tokenisation, transformer block(MLP-mixer： changing multi-head attention layers to MLP , meta-former: substituting multi-head attention layers to average pooling), changing objective function(self-supervised, contrastive learning), and multi modality. It's still unclear whether convolution, attention or MLP will win this game. Reference Naseer, M. M., Ranasinghe, K., Khan, S. H., Hayat, M., Shahbaz Khan, F., &amp; Yang, M. H. (2021).

Instead, I follow a reference video above directly and make notes together with it. History and Timeline Given that the GPT series are all developed by the OpenAI and the Transformer &amp; Bert are developed by Google, it seems there are two companies combating. And it is inevitable to compare these two series. From the perspective of number of cites, it is obviously that OpenAI have catch less attention from the academic world despite the huge cost. But it's not because GPT series are less novel, but because the goal of GPT series is bigger than that of Transformer &amp; Bert. Transformer is originally developed for Machine Translation task only. And Bert simply aims to push the pre-training technic forward. That's the reason why Bert performs better than GPT if the number of parameters are the same. As a result, GPT is harder and more expensive to train a decent model. And the size of model make others hardly to reconstruct it. From the companies' perspective, OpenAI does this because they want to build the strong AI, but Transformer &amp; Bert are developed only by the teams of Google. GPT-1 Abstract The whole idea is similar to what CV did in the last several decades, that is pre-training of a model on a massive dataset followed by fine-tuning on a small specialist dataset. Lacking of large labelled data such as ImageNet of 10 million, however, NLP can't do what CV does exactly. The scale of machine translation database might reach 10 million but one piece of image possesses almost 10 times of information than a sentence. So the database is still not big enough. GPT makes a big step by using unlabelled data for pre-training. And then aero shot on GPT-2 makes another big step. It is fair to say CV led the trend of deep learning in the first 5 years, but recent years, more new thoughts are coming from the NLP field. And these new thoughts have inspired the CV field as well such as ViT, CLIP and MAE. Besides, actually it had been a long time since NLP started to use unsupervised pre-training back then. For example, the word embedding model had been used for decades. But, the word embedding can only be seen as a layer, extra layers of model need to be designed to suit for various tasks. With GPT, however, the architecture doesn't need much change, only adjusting the input to suit the tasks is ok. The result is good but not as good as BERT, but the novelty of this paper is much better than BERT. Introduction After briefly introducing the word embedding, problems of pre-training more than word-level data are presented. For example the type of optimisation objectives and how to transfer the extracted information to the tasks. The main reason of this problem is the variety of NLP tasks. There is no way to suit all the needs together. Then this paper introduces a semi-supervised method which has been explained many times. But actually GPT and BERT are normally called self-supervised model. Though they are the same to me. Semi-supervised learning is a common concept in the Machine Learning. It refers learning from a mix of massive unlabelled data and a few labelled data. Then the architecture is described. Interestingly, in order to list the reason of choosing transformer over RNN as backbone. The authors say This model choice provides us with a more structured memory for handling long-term dependencies in text, compared to alternatives like recurrent networks, resulting in robust transfer performance across diverse tasks. Besides, the paper accents the task-specific input adaptions, which is the key of this paper. Framework Unsupervised learning GPT uses a task that giving the data of un-k to un-1 to predict the un. So the likelihood function to be maximised is: \\[ L_{1}(\\mathcal{U})=\\sum_{i} \\log P\\left(u_{i} \\mid u_{i-k}, \\ldots, u_{i-1} ; \\Theta\\right) \\] Because the predicting task, the mechanism of the mask multi-head attention of transformer decoder matches the likelihood function perfectly. Because in the first layer of the transformer decoder, the data after u{i} are simply masked to be 0. And the whole pre-training process is like this: \\[ \\begin{aligned} h_{0} &amp;=U W_{e}+W_{p} \\\\ h_{l} &amp;=\\operatorname{transformer}\\_\\operatorname{block}\\left(h_{l-1}\\right) \\forall i \\in[1, n] \\\\ P(u) &amp;=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(h_{n} W_{e}^{T}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] Compared with BERT, the biggest difference is never encoder or decoder, bidirectional or one-way along. The key is the pre-training task they choose, the completion task that Bert use is much easier than GPT's prediction task. Because this is the difference between interpolation and extrapolation. Therefore, BERT outperforms GPT on the same number of parameters. But the potential of the GPT series goes far beyond BERT. As a result, it took OpenAI years to develop such an impressive GPT-3 model. On another side, however, GPT's prediction task leads to a different architecture with BERT. And the decoder architecture makes the GPT model hard to be bidirectional from the start. We'll see how it conquer this. Supervised fine-tuning The fine-tuning task follows the standard supervise learning process as follows: \\[ L_{2}(\\mathcal{C})=\\sum_{(x, y)} \\log P\\left(y \\mid x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{m}\\right) \\] with \\[ P\\left(y \\mid x^{1}, \\ldots, x^{m}\\right)=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(h_{l}^{m} W_{y}\\right) \\] And the authors find it helpful to optimise the L1 and L2 together as: \\[ L_{3}(\\mathcal{C})=L_{2}(\\mathcal{C})+\\lambda * L_{1}(\\mathcal{C}) \\] Task-specific input transformations The last thing to do is how to apply this framework to different tasks. Similar to with BERT, the pre-trained transformer block doesn't have to be changed. Experiments The dataset GPT trained on is BooksCorpus dataset, and the model has 12 layers with Hmodel = 768, same as BERTbase. Although the transformer encoder has one layer less than the decoder, GPT and BERT's numbers of parameters are still at the same level. Yet BERT has a 3 times larger BERTlarge model than the base. Because in addition to the BookCorpus dataset, BERT uses one more dataset for pre-training, in total the dataset is 4 times larger than GPT's. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al., 2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). And unfortunately, the average accuracy of BERTbase is higher than GPT at this time. Besides with the BERTlarge model , the accuracy can go higher, as shown below in BERT's paper. GPT-2 After GPT-1 got defeated by BERT in 4 months, of course, GPT-2 aims to fight back and beat BERT to the ground. Considering the decoder path can't shift to the encoder with dignity, the simplest way then is to enlarge the model and the dataset. But what if it's still not working? Abstract After developing a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText, and training on a new1.5B parameter model. The result turns out to be no significant difference with BERT. So they bring out another sell point, zero shot. Actually, the zero-shot behaviour is mentioned in the last section of GPT-1's paper in order to understand more of the unsupervised pre-training mechanism. And in GPT-2, this behaviour is brought front to increase the novelty. Introduction Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a problem setup in machine learning, where at test time, a learner observes samples from classes, which were not observed during training, and needs to predict the class that they belong to. Zero-shot methods generally work by associating observed and non-observed classes through some form of auxiliary information, which encodes observable distinguishing properties of objects.[1] The main-steam approach is one dataset - one task instead of one dataset - multiple tasks because of the generalisation that state of art models lack. Yet multitask learning (trending 2000-2010) represents the idea of training one model with a combination of multiple datasets and different loss functions. So GPT-2 takes the idea of multitask learning and trains the model with the zero-shot setting, under which the downstream tasks can be handled with no collecting of supervised data or fine-tuning. The result is competitive and promising according to the authors. Approach The model architectures of GPT1 and GPT2 are pretty much the same. But the input methods are different. In detail, recalling that during fine tuning process, the GPT1 introduces extra tokens such as [start], [Delim] and [Extract] to modify the input. But in GPT2 without the supervised fine-tuning process, these extra tokens would cause confusion. As a result, the downstream task input need to be more likely to the natural language when constructing. As a result, the authors introduce what we are used to calling it \"prompt\", here are the examples: For example, a translation training example can be written as the sequence (translate to french, english text, french text). Likewise, a reading comprehension training example can be written as (answer the question, document, question, answer). And afterward, 2 ideas for why this would work are discussed. First, if the model is powerful enough, it might be capable of understanding the prompts. Second, in such a big dataset, this kind of data structure exists. Take machine translation as an example, there should be many sentences containing \"translate to French\", English text, and French text. The authors point out some of them below. Examples of machine translation ”I’m not the cleverest man in the world, but like they say in French: Je ne suis pas un imbecile [I’m not a fool]. In a now-deleted post from Aug. 16, Soheil Eid, Tory candidate in the riding of Joliette, wrote in French: ”Mentez mentez, il en restera toujours quelque chose,” which translates as, ”Lie lie and something will always remain.”“I hate the word ‘perfume,”’ Burr says. ‘It’s somewhat better in French: ‘parfum.’If listened carefully at 29:55, a conversation can be heard between two guys in French: “-Comment on fait pour aller de l’autre coté? -Quel autre coté?”, which means “- How do you get to the other side? - What side?”. If this sounds like a bit of a stretch, consider this question in French: As-tu aller au cinéma?, or Did you go to the movies?, which literally translates as Have-you to go to movies/theater? “Brevet Sans Garantie Du Gouvernement”, translated to English: “Patented without government warranty”. Training data After considering the need for larger data and the disadvantage(noise) of the existing dataset, they developed a new dataset. The data is collected by first crawling 45 million links discussed on Reddit, and then extracting all the contents of these pages. The dataset contains 8 million documents, 40 GB of text. Experiment With 4 level of model, the one-short performances on 4 downstream tasks are shown blow: It can be seen that first 3 tasks, the results are not the best yet not the worst, however, the performance on Question Answering is bad, and other works perform way better than GPT-2. But this is not over, because in the figure, there is still room for performance improvement on all 4 tasks as the size of the larger model increases. So here comes GPT-3. GPT-3 The value of an article depends on the topic, effectiveness and novelty. GPT-2 has rather low effectiveness but strong novelty. As a result, GPT-3 aims to promote the effectiveness of its predecessor, while loosing the zero-shot condition to few-shot condition. Abstract The parameters of GPT-3 are enlarged 10 times to 175 billion. When applying GPT-3 to downstream tasks, strong performance is achieved without gradient update or fine-tuning. Besides, GPT-3 is capable of generating articles that are indistinguishable from humans' work. Besides, unlikely to former papers, this is a 63-page technic report. Without limitation of words or page number, it is very detailed, especially for the experiment and discussion sections. Introduction There are 3 problems of current pre-training + fine-tuning language model: A large labeled dataset is still needed for a good result The pre-training model is not really generalisable because of the need for fine-tuning Human doesn't need large fine tuning dataset When introducing their work, the authors try to re-define the concept of \"meta-learning\" and \"in-context learning\". What they really mean are training a huge generalisable model and train without updating the gradient, respectively. Then 3 evaluation methods are presented: Few-shot learning: 10-100 task-related data One-shot learning Zero-short learning And the performance with model size is plotted below (1.3B matches the GPT-2 model). Can be seen the final accuracy (few shot - 175B) almost doubled the former GPT-2 accuracy (1.3B zero-short) Approach In this section, fine-tuning, few-shot, one-shot, zero-shot learning are explained first in this figure below: The right column denotes the traditional fine-tuning process that requires extra few gradient update steps. The left side shows how GPT-3 applies \"in-context learning\" during inference. Basically, the input is divided by 3 parts, task description, example, and prompt. The task description and prompt are ended by \":\", and \"=&gt;\" respectively. The Transformer Decoder extracts the features of the \"context\" and then predicts the next several words starting from the prompt. As a result, the model is able to infer without gradient updates. Yet it comes 2 problems with few-shot: Unable to process really long examples. For example, thousands of English-French translation dataset is easy to get access but they can rarely be leveraged to promote the model performance. The inference is one-time thing, meaning the model can't actually learn from previous task description or example. Same samples have to be inputed again an again. As a result, the few-shot learning is not commonly used. Model and Architectures GPT-3 uses the same architecture as GPT-2 yet uses the methods form \"Sparse Transformer\" to modify the layers. And 8 different size of models are developed. Yet compared with previous models, GPT-3 is \"fatter\" ,meaning with same dmodel (192x of GPT3small), nlayers is smaller (only 8x of GPT3small). The mini-batch size goes up to 3.2M, definitely not mini. Large batch size improves the computational performance and parallelism while reducing the noise in each batch and making the model easier to overfitting. However, this defect is not evident in GPT-3. It is still an open question, now people consider it from two aspects: (1) the internal structure prevents the model from overfitting. (2) Such a large model is able to search for large space and it is more prone to converge to a simpler architecture. The learning rate decreases with batch size increasing according to research1 and research2, also counter-intuitive. Former work shows that batch size should increase linear with the learning rate. Training Dataset With a huge model, Common Craw dataset has come back as an option. The authors clean this dataset in 3 steps: A logistic classification model is built, taking samples of Common Craw dataset as negative and WebText as positive. Such model is used on the whole dataset of Common Craw to predict positive (high quality) or negative. The positive stay and the negative are filtered. LSH algorithm is applied on the remaining dataset to filter the similar content. More \"clean\" datasets are mixed in with weight. Training Process Specific training details are not presented. Information so far is DGX-1 cluster is used. Results The results are too many so only interesting figures are covered. From the figure, the power law distribution of performance with compute are found, i.e. in order to decrease the validation loss linearly, the FLOPS need to increase exponentially. This still is a major problem in Machine Learning. This figure shows the compression of results with Zero-shot SOTO and human. Nothing to comment. Just ... good. And on the Open-Domain QA tasks, GPT-3 outperform other models such as google T5. Google T5 can be considered as a model with both encoder and decoder. And few shot learning outperform SOTO fine tuning models. In the machine translation task, it is interesting to see that other language to English is better than English to others. Then a news article is generated with GPT-3 with numbers, years and time that makes the article look legit. Limitations Text synthesis, the predicted texts are always looping. The bidirectional limit still exist because of the decoder structure. The tokens that learned by GPT3 are equally weighted, yet wasting the model on the meaningless but high frequent function words. No experience in Videos or real-world physical interaction. The interpretation is still low. It's nearly impossible to know how does such a big model works.

Paper link: Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding Useful links: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PL411M7eQ ​ https://youtu.be/UYPa347-DdE ​ Deep contextualized word representations - arXiv Notes by sections 0. Abstract The name of BERT might come from one of its important related work, ELMo. And Elmo and Bert are both characters in a TV show Sesame Street. The abstract focus on the two related work, ELMo and GPT. The bidirectional feature is in contrast to the unidirectional GPT model. And the \"without substantial task specific architecture modifications\" feature compares with the RNN-based ELMo model, whose architecture might get modified when training downstream tasks. Yet the ELMo model is bidirectional and GPT model is easy to use. When claiming a model is great, it is good to provide both the absolute accuracy and the relative accuracy compared with others. Just like this paper does. 6. Conclusion To summarise, this is a classical A+B type of research. The idea of BERT is simple, combine the advantages of the bidirectional network with a rather old RNN base (ELMo), and the unidirectional network with a transformer base (GPT). And in detail, 2 pre-training tasks are designed. The main contribution of this network is showing that bidirectional information is important. 1. Introduction From the history introduction, it turns out BERT is not the first to apply pre-training on NLP. It's been a while. But BERT makes it popular. 2. Related work 2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised data This is what the CV area does most often. Yet it is not effective in NLP. It is partly because of the lacking of data. Another reason might be the existing labeled data focus only on language inference and machine translation, which are too different from other NLP tasks. So BERT and GPT use unlabelled data to pre-train and prove that unsupervised pre-train on a massive data is more effective than supervised pre-train on a relatively small data set. And, interestingly, this trend in NLP gradually effects the CV world. Nowadays unsupervised fine-tuning is becoming more and more popular in CV area. 3. Bert In the first part, the pre-training and fine-tuning framework is briefly covered. A paper should be self-consistent, meaning that if a mechanic is fundamental in your area and essential to your work. It is a good habit to briefly introduce it, even if all the people in the area know it. Model Architecture And the architecture is as simple as just take the encoder part of the transformer model. number of layers (i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as H, and the number of self-attention heads as A. BERTBASE(L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Parameters=110M) and BERTLARGE(L=24, H=1024, A=16, Total Parameters=340M). Because the hidden size of each multi-head attention sublayer is set as 64. And in transformer tradition, H = A * 64. So the multi-head number A actually depends on the hidden size H. As a result, the way of calculating the number of parameters is shown below. Input/Output Representations Why Bert need a pair of sentence to handle downstream tasks such as Machine Translation, unlike its predecessor Transformer? Because in Transformer, the input is a pair of sequences, taken by encoder and decoder respectively. But Bert is only an encoder. In English-Chinese Translation task for example, for transformer, the encoder take the English version and the decoder take the Chinese version, for Bert, the English version and Chinese version are glued with a special token [sept] then be inputed to the model. Besides the [sept] token, another embedding is introduced into the embedding layer, the sequence model. Details are shown below. 3.1 Pre-training BERT The paper provides an example of each task in Appendix section Masked LM and the Masking Procedure, just go for it and have a look if don't understand. Next Sentence Prediction The next sentence prediction task can be illustrated in the following examples. Input = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP] he bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP] Label = IsNext Input = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP] penguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP] Label = NotNext The \"flight ##less\" is because of the WordPiece embedding method that Bert uses. \"##\" means this token is split from last token, in this case, flightless is the original token. Because flightless is rarely used, the WordPiece embedding split this word into two. 3.2 Fine-tuning BERT Bert's architecture has one advantage over the transformer's, the self-attention allows model look both the two sentences. And the encoder-decoder model can't do that. As a result, the fine-tuning can be a little bit hazy. 4 Experiments 4.2 SQuAD v1.1 We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32. This misleads the people for a while. People found when fine-tuning with Bert, the variance of each results are high i.e. the result of fine-tuning is unstable. Then people found it is because 3 epochs are not enough. Besides, the optimiser that the original Bert model used is an incomplete version of Adam which is not stable for small epoch number. And the follow-ups change it into the original Adam. From the processes of the 3 experiments, it can be seen it is easy for BERT to be applied to downstream tasks. Just need to modify the input data in the form of the Bert sequence, and add another output layer. As a result, with BERT, massive number of tasks can be trained under a rather simple architecture. 5 Ablation Studies It is obvious the 4th architecture BiLSTM is from the idea of ELMO. And all the variation lead to a deterioration of the acc, especially in the MRPC task. Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) Dataset Created by Dolan et al. at 2005, the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) Dataset contains pairs of sentences which have been extracted from news sources on the web, along with human annotations indicating whether each pair captures a paraphrase/semantic equivalence relationship., in English language. Containing 5,8 in Text file format. In the Effect of model size part, they claim with a large model size, huge improvement can be reached. And this leads a trend of increasing the model size in NLP, for example, the 100 billon GPT-3, and 500 billion model Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation (MT-NLG). The boundary of NLP will be push further. Reviews Writing: The biggest sell point in this paper is chosen as the \"bidirectional\". From today's view, the contributions of BERT are so more than this. Besides, when say to choose a feature, it is better to discuss both the pros and the cons of the choice. For example, compared with GPT, the encoder is used instead of the decoder. The pros are the bidirectional feature, but the cons is the resulting difficulty in applying on generative tasks such as the machine translation. Besides, BERT follows a whole ideal path of solving deep learning problems. That is after pre-training on a deep and huge model on a huge unlabelled dataset, the model can be applied to many small tasks with a few steps of fine tuning.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"paper reading: A gentle introduction to graph neural networks","slug":"paper-reading-A-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-networks","date":"2022-04-14T05:58:38.000Z","updated":"2022-05-02T06:36:51.265Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/14/paper-reading-A-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-networks/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/14/paper-reading-A-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-networks/","excerpt":"This is a tech blog written by google research team in 2021 that introducing the graph neural network.

For example, for a molecule represented as a graph, we might want to predict what the molecule smells like, or whether it will bind to a receptor implicated in a disease. The example is actually a simple task example, and the loops can be detected with ordinary algorithm such as: Fast and Slow Pointer: Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. But with more complicated task, GNN can be useful. And here is the related Leetcode question: No.141: Linked List Cycle. This is reminiscent of standard convolution: in essence, message passing and convolution are operations to aggregate and process the information of an element’s neighbors in order to update the element’s value. In graphs, the element is a node, and in images, the element is a pixel. However, the number of neighboring nodes in a graph can be variable, unlike in an image where each pixel has a set number of neighboring elements. When introducing the message passing method, this blog makes an analogy with the convolution. And in addition to the however part mentioned in this blog, another difference is that in convolution, each element's value is weighted differently while in the aggregation method they are all the same. Interestingly, similar weights can be achieved with Graph Attention Networks, which is introduced in later section. Another way of communicating information between graph attributes is via attention. For example, when we consider the sum-aggregation of a node and its 1-degree neighboring nodes we could also consider using a weighted sum. A common scoring function is the inner product and nodes are often transformed before scoring into query and key vectors via a linear map to increase the expressivity of the scoring mechanism. Reviews Writing: the whole article is well coherent and fluent, building the knowledge of GNN step by step, from a highly simplified model to the real GNN. The beautiful interactive figures make the article easy to read and digestible. Yet lacking mathematics and codes is both pros and cons. Unfortunately, tarting today Distill will be taking a one year hiatus, which may be extended indefinitely. Graph neural network: a graph is a powerful tool so that all kinds of data can be described as a graph. But this power leads to a huge difficulty in optimisation. One reason is the sparsity, the dynamic structure makes it difficult the train on CPU or GPU. Another is that GNN is very sensitive to hyper-parameters, just like the experiment section of this blog shows. As such, it is an active research area yet rarely deployed in industry.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"paper reading: transformer","slug":"paper-reading-transformer","date":"2022-04-12T15:31:21.000Z","updated":"2022-05-02T06:51:47.291Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/12/paper-reading-transformer/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/12/paper-reading-transformer/","excerpt":"The transformer is the most important achievement in the last 5 years.

Paper link: Attention is all you need Useful link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pu411o7BE Notes by sections 0. Abstract According to the abstract, this work is first presented in the small field of machine translation, but because of the strong ability of generalisation. The transformer architecture has been extended in other fields such as CV and video. 6. Conclusion In the last part of the conclusion section, the future of transformer is partly predicted by the authors, though most of these future work is done by other researchers. 1. Introduction Firstly, traditional RNN, or GRU has been introduced. Then after a brief description of the sequential nature of RNN based models, the main problems of them are presented. That is, poor ability of parallelising, and poor long-range dependencies. Later after the introduction of the attention framework and how to combine attention into RNN, transformer is presented. 2. Background First, with the goal of gaining the ability to parallelise, the authors look back on using CNN for sequential data. With CNN, parallelising ability is in its nature and with multiple channels, multiple features can be learned through training. Likewise, the transformer is also parallelisable and Multi-Head Attention is designed with the ability to learn multiple features. But additionally the transformer is easier to learn dependencies between distant positions. Afterwards, related work on self-attention and memory network is mentioned. And both the connections and distinctions with transformer are elaborated. 3. Model Architecture After introducing the basic idea of the encoder-decoder architecture, the key transformer architecture diagram is given. And each part of the model is briefly described. (The diagram in this blog below is not the original, but a combination of 3 diagrams in the paper.) 3.1 encoder decoder stacks Encoder: In addition to briefly describing the encoder architecture, the authors mention that in order to avoid the projection step on the residual connection layers, the same input and output dimension is chosen in each sublayer, which is different from what CNN normally does. And this simple design yields the super parameters of the encoder to 2: Nx - the number of the \"encoder block\" and d_model - the feature dimension of the output layers. And this design makes the follow-up work such as bert, GPT-3 simple as well. Here is one thing that has been ignored: the definition of layer norm. Unlike batch normalization, Layer Normalization directly estimates the normalization statistics from the summed inputs to the neurons within a hidden layer so the normalization does not introduce any new dependencies between training cases. More is on https://paperswithcode.com/method/layer-normalization Decoder: Because in the prediction mode, the decoder is self-regressing, meaning that when predict y_t, only x_0 to x_t are available. However, the self-attention layer is able to attend to all the data i.e. x_0 - x_n. To prevent this, a masked multi-head attention layer is introduced so that when predict y_t, x_t+1 - x_n are masked. 3.2 Attention Similarly, after running over the definition of attention mechanism, the 2 modifications: scaled dot-product attention and Multi-head attention are described. As we all known, there are two methods (attention scoring functions) of calculating the similarity of query and key(attention weights over the value). One is additive attention. It is complex but allows different length of key (dk) and query (qk). And Additive attention layer includes learnable parameters that can be tuned during training. Another one is dot-product attention, it is simply dot product of the transverse query and key matrix. It requires same length of query and key and no learnable parameters are introduced. scaled dot-product attention It pretty much is the dot-product attention multiply with a scaling factor of 1/√dk. And it is because for large dk, the deviation of the dot-product results might get too large, and the according gradient can get extremely small and hard to train. But look the figure 2 of the paper, an optional mask node is shown in the computation graph. And the algorithm of mask is not described in detail. Basically when calculating q_t, in the mask node, the attention scores a_t+1 - a_t are substituted to a huge negative so that after softmax, the attention weight is 0 on values v_t+1 to v_n. And it is corresponding to the how the decoder works in the prediction mode. multi-head attention How mutli-head works is introducing clearly in the paper: linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values The question is why doing that. First, no learnable parameters in the dot-product attention, and second, to mimic the CNN extracting the features from different perspectives. Applications of Attention in our Model It is well shown on the whole architecture figure. In the figure it consists of 2 self-attention block and 1 attention block, where key-value is from the encoder and query is from the decoder. 3.3 Position-wise feed-forward networks It is a simply an MLP with one hidden layer. And the hidden size is 4 times of the input and output size. 3.4 Embedding and softmax One point is they multiply the weights by√d_model. And first same reason with before, and second, with scaled weights, the scale matches the scale of positional encoding described below. 3.5 Positional Encoding Different with RNN, transformer architecture reads no sequence information. And the authors add the positional information in the input data. 4 Why Self-Attention Basically it explains the table 1 below: It might be the case but it's not been accepted by some researchers. And the restricted self-attention is rarely used. The table shows that if n and d are the same, self-attention, RNN, and CNN possess the same complexity per layer, but self-attention outperforms them on the sequential operations and the max path length. But actually, a huge mount of layers and parameters and data are required for a self-attention model achieving a similar result as RNN and CNN. And nowadays all models based on the transformer are very expensive. 6 Results 6.2 Model Variations From Table 3, we can see the hyper parameters are not so much, and this simple design benefits the follow-ups. For example Bert and GPT. Reviews Writing: It is concise and neat. But if the possible, it's better to describe why of doing it, and show more thoughts on the model to make the paper \"deeper\". Model: Transformer change the NLP filed just like how CNN change the CV filed. Through after transformer based model such as BERT, it is possible to pretrain a huge model to rise all the NLP performance. Besides, in other fields such as CV and audio, transformer becomes a great rising point. And the fact that transformer may suitable for all the deep learning tasks gives a new thought of muti-model learning. Maybe a general model able to extracting video, pictures, audio into a same semetic space is coming soon. Yet, despite the great experiment performance, we still can't fully understand why transformer works. For example, attention is not all one need, because the residual connection and MLP are all critical. We still don't know why. Why without explicitly model the sequence or the space, transformer outperform RNN and CNN. One explanation is that it is because transformer's inductive bias is more relaxed than either recurrent or convolutional architectures. And that is why huge amount of data are needed for transformer to achieve a good result.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"paper reading: ResNet","slug":"paper-reading-ResNet","date":"2022-04-09T12:42:00.000Z","updated":"2022-05-02T07:03:43.189Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/09/paper-reading-ResNet/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/09/paper-reading-ResNet/","excerpt":"Since its introduction in 2015, ResNet and its variants have accounted for 50% of deep neural networks in use.

Abstract An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset Not only the 1st place results on several tasks but the potential to train a 1000-layer network made this Residual framework a huge attention. Unfortunately, due to the 8-page limitation of CDPR, and the massive number of results to be presented, there is no room for the conclusion section in this paper. Key figure This is the key figure showing that the degradation in accuracy caused by the depth in plain networks has been well addressed in ResNet. 1. Introduction This section first presents the need of training deeper neural network. And the first obstacle that encountered during this process is non-convergence cause by gradient vanishing / explosion, and it has been well addressed by normalised initialisation and intermediate normalisation layers. And the main focus of this paper is the second obstacle i.e. deeper networks have difficulty converging to lower losses and may perform worse than networks with fewer layers. And they addressed this obstacle by introducing the Residual learning framework as shown in the pic below. And this framework is easy to implement in caffe, the most popular DL framework back to 2015. Afterwards experiments results are briefly mentioned. The introduction section played as an expanded version of the abstract and the residual method is mainly focused, which is helpful for readers to catch the essence of the whole paper. 2. Related work Residual representation Actually the concept of residual is more common in the fields of statistics and machine learning. For example in linear regression, the residual denotes the distance between the estimated and the actual results (residual=y- y ̂ in 2D). And the iterative process of calculating the regression line aims to minimise the mean square of the residual loss. In addition, the well-known GB gradient boosting algorithm for machine learning is also based on the residual loss. Because this paper mainly focus on computer vision, so these early work isn't included. Shortcut connections It looks like this paper combines these two well-studied approaches with amazing results. First ideas are not necessary to make a paper a classic. Just like the quote on the Google Scholar homepage: stand on the shoulders of giants. 3. Deep Residual Learning Let us consider H(x) as an underlying mapping to be fit by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net), with x denoting the inputs to the first of these layers. First is the meaning of H(x), underlying mapping is actually intuitive but it confused me for a while, so here's the answer below: What does the phrase 'underlying mapping' mean? - Data Science Stack Functions map domains to ranges. Neural networks learn such functions, so you can think of a neural network as a mapping of input spaces to output spaces. Deep neural networks are stacked with many layers of course, and each of those can be viewed as sub-functions of the network with their own underlying mappings. For example, each layer in a convolution network consists of some convolution layers + some other helper layers such as normalisation and pooling. Next the paper brings up 2 methods to address the shape difference between X the input and H(x) the output for one particular layer that may occur. Option (A): 0 padding and Option (B): 1*1 convolution to project the channel and pooling with stride to adjust the height and width. 4. Experiments Identity vs. Projection Shortcuts After introducing the well known architectures, the 2 methods to address the shape difference are also studied. 3 groups are studies, Option (A): 0 padding, Option (B): projection when necessary, Option (C): projection to all layers. And because of the increasing of parameters caused by the projection, it is not surprise to discover C is better than B than A. And Option (B) is the winner considering both the performance and the efficiency. Deeper Bottleneck Architectures In ResNet18 and ResNet 34, the standard architecture is fine. But for deeper network, in order to decrease the flops, the bottleneck architectures is deployed. Basically in each residual block, decreasing the number of channel by 1*1 convolution first then expend the channel back to the number of input channel. As can be seen in Table 1, the flops of ResNet34 is similar to that in ResNet50. But this is only theory, in practice ResNet50 is obviously more expensive because of the inefficiency of computing 1*1 conv. Exploring Over 1000 layers Networks with layer numbers from 20 to 1202 are applied on dataset CIFAR-10 (With only output size 32*32 compared with &gt;300*300 on ImageNet, the networks are slightly modified). And the results shows that even with an aggressive depth on a tiny dataset, no difficulty of optimisation occurs. Yet shown on Table6, the test set classification error goes up compared with the shallower models because of the overfitting. Some Reviews This is a model with relatively simple idea and the authors have a great writing skill to make this paper neat and clear. The main contribution of this paper is introducing the residual block and skipping connection in deep learning. Although the authors intuitively explain and provide some experiments, the explanation is not currently accepted by the mainstream. Today, the reason why ResNet can achieve better results than ordinary networks is mainly because of its property of preventing vanishing gradients. The ordinary network without the residual framework cannot be trained in the later stage of training. It's still an open question why the 1000-layer network has low level of overfitting on a simple dataset. The same question is good performance on large networks such as the transformer series. One explanation is that despite the large network size, the intrinsic model complexity is low.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"paper reading","slug":"paper-reading","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/tags/paper-reading/"}],"author":"Ryan LI"},{"title":"paper reading: AlexNet","slug":"paper-reading-AlexNet","date":"2022-04-07T14:25:50.000Z","updated":"2022-05-02T07:08:14.108Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/04/07/paper-reading-AlexNet/","link":"","permalink":"https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/04/07/paper-reading-AlexNet/","excerpt":"It has been 10 years since AlexNet has been brought out.

A good paper needs new thoughts for the model, or at least some explanations, while this paper only presented how they applied 3 tricks and how good their results are. However, there was no doubt an influential hit in the area of computer vision, which has a passion for refreshing the top list. And this influence spread to other areas gradually with deeper studies on it. Notes by sections 0. Absturct To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. In addition to a brief introduction to the model, the use of GPU is also mentioned in the abstract. And works around GPU are mentioned all the time. It was really a tough engineering job from the perspective of the first writer. But it is not important for an acdemic paper. Besides, since the emergence of CUDA in 2007, the application of GPU in the ML field in 2012 is not uncommon, and MATLAB is mainly used as a ML tool with a large number of GPU acceleration libraries. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry At last, the result in the ILSVRC-2012 competition is as good as knocking the second to the ground and then showing off with a set of backflips. So personally it might look like a technical report, but it's still an outstanding paper and absolutly worth reading. 7. Discussion In stead of conclusion, this paper leaves a discussion as the last section, which is unsual. For example, removing any of the middle layers results in a loss of about 2% for the top-1 performance of the network. So the depth really is important for achieving our results The depth is important, but it is insufficient to be simply concluded from the degradation caused by removing one middle layer, ignoring other effects such as superparameter settings. And, considering only the conculsion, a more complete one might be, depth and width are both very important. The ratio of height and width matters. To simplify our experiments, we did not use any unsupervised pre-training even though we expect that it will help Before AlexNet, it was common to warm up the NN with massive unlabelled images before the actual training i.e. use an unsupervised model as an initial. And the goal of the field of machine learning was to extract the features of data through large-scale unsupervised models. However, this sentence steered the entire field from unsupervised to supervised learning, which, according to the machine learning pioneers such as Hinton and LeCun, was a \"wrong route\". But with the rise of the pre-trained language models such as Bert, and the contrative learning model in CV field such as MoCo, the unsupervised route is gradually comming back to the foreground. Ultimately we would like to use very large and deep convolutional nets on video sequences where the temporal structure provides very helpful information that is missing or far less obvious in static images. Actually video sequences are still a tough area beacause of the high computational comsumpution and the copyright issues. Key figure The right part is the most important result in this paper, though it isn't been discussed much in this paper. Actually it shows the last layer feature vectors perform really well in the semantic space i.e. deep neural network is very suitable to extract features from data. 1. Introduction To improve their performance, we can collect larger datasets, learn more powerful models, and use better techniques for preventing overfitting. The paper leads one route of deep learning, which is, with large dataset and model, developing powerful regularization methods to prevent overfitting. However there is a new route, which is focusing on designing good architecture s.t. the overfitting won't happen with large model. Our network contains a number of new and unusual features which improve its performance and reduce its training time, which are detailed in Section 3. we used several effective techniques for preventing overfitting, which are described in Section 4. These two are the innovative points. People can then follow their work later, which makes this paper a cornerstone. 2. Dataset We did not pre-process the images in any other way, except for subtracting the mean activity over the training set from each pixel. So we trained our network on the (centered) raw RGB values of the pixels. There is one more point that is not emphasized. Previously, features of an image (such as SIFT) were always used as input instead of raw RGB values. Datasets such as ImageNet provided SIFT of their image set as well. The end-to-end nature is the selling point of a series of deep learning papers that follow. 3. Architecture 3.1. ReLU From a present point of view, ReLU is not that important for speeding up the training process. Other activation functions still work. It's the simplicity of ReLU that makes it stick. 4. Reducing Overfitting A metaphore of overfitting: In order to get a high score on an exam, you memorize all the answers to the exercises instead of understanding the question. 4.1 Data Augmentation The second form of data augmentation consists of altering the intensities of the RGB channels in training images. Specifically, we perform PCA on the set of RGB pixel values throughout the ImageNet training set. PCA is here use as a augmentation method which follow-up work don't follow. For example, in ResNet a standard color augmentation is used with no fancy methods. And nowadays, standard color augmentation wins. 4.2 dropout There is, however, a very efficient version of model combination that only costs about a factor of two during training. The recently-introduced technique, called “dropout” Here dropout is considered a light version of model ensembling, but later study below has shown that the effect of dropout is actually equivalent to weight decay/regularization, yet there is no specific weight decay method equivalent to it algorithmically. one way to obtain some of the benefits of dropout without stochasticity is to marginalize the noise to obtain a regularizer that does the same thing as the dropout procedure, in expectation. We showed that for linear regression this regularizer is a modified form of L2 regularization. For more complicated models, it is not obvious how to obtain an equivalent regularizer. 5. Details of learning we trained our models using stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 128 examples, momentum of 0.9, and weight decay of 0.0005 momentum, weight decay with SGD has become a standard method afterwards. We initialized the weights in each layer from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation 0.01 (0, 0.01) is usually chosen as the initialization parameter pair in most standard-sized models. (0, 0.02) is in use even for large models like Bert. We trained the network for roughly 90 cycles through the training set of 1.2 million images, which took five to six days on two NVIDIA GTX 580 3GB GPUs. Similar to what is happening now with training NLP, maybe it will drive the next evolution in hardware. And probably hardware similar to TPU would be popular. 6. Results 6.1 Qualitative Evaluations The kernels on GPU 1 are largely color-agnostic, while the kernels on on GPU 2 are largely color-specific. The kernels on GPU 1 are largely color-agnostic, while the kernels on on GPU 2 are largely color-specific Interesting problem but less focused by follow up work. consider the feature activations induced by an image at the last, 4096-dimensional hidden layer. If two images produce feature activation vectors with a small Euclidean separation, we can say that the higher levels of the neural network consider them to be similar. This is an intuitive work as talked before, and follow up work such as Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks dig deeper trying to interperate the NN. And interpretion is very important for works related to physics or fairness. Reference Srivastava, N., Hinton, G., Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., &amp; Salakhutdinov, R. (2014).

Introduction Learning rate is one critical parameter in alliterative algorithms, including PDE and ODE solving, optimization, and eigenvalue calculation. In the deep learning area, the learning rate is more than critical because of the notorious difficulty on Stochastic gradient descent. Strictly, there are two ways of adjusting the learning rate: learning rate scheduling: adjust the global learning rate during iteration adaptive learning rate: adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on their gradients updates(moments), also called adaptive gradient or gradient descent optimization. In this article, learning rate schedule is mainly discussed. Afterward, \"learning rate\" refers to the \"global learning rate\". Methods of learning rate scheduling Apart from the constant learning rate, there are several ways to schedule the learning rate: change with epoch numbers learning rate decay: linear, step... learning rate down then up: stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts(SGDR) and Cyclical Learning rates(CLR) warmup change on some validation measurements: plateau learning rate decay Under the upper concepts of decaying the learning rate while training, how to choose a specific decay policy is personal. It can be continuous or step, linear or polynomial, exponential or trigonometric. In articles, stepped learning rate decay is more often used as the default choice. For example, Zagoruyko, S., &amp; Komodakis, N set the initial learning rate as 0.1 and drop it by 0.2 every 60 epochs on their modified version of ResNet. And this version of learning rate decay is set as the control group to compare with the SGDR strategy later in Ilya Loshchilov &amp; Frank Hutter's work. And in practice, the cosine annealing policy is a common choice today and can be used either alone or in combination with warmup and SGDR. Explanation Because of the presence of stochastic noise, the entire gradient descent process is not straightforward. With a constant learning rate, as shown in the gradient contour map below, the minima can not be reached with a constant step (blue) due to the relatively small steps at the bottom. And a lower minimum can be reached if the learning rate descends with the gradient i.e. epoch(green). #### SGDR and CLR ##### SGDR Stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts(SGDR) is firstly proposed to Deep learning in Ilya Loshchilov &amp; Frank Hutter's work. They introduced a policy of reinitializing the learning rate every certain number of epochs. Applying cosine annealing learning rate decay during each resulting \"mini-run\", the results perform fascinating. As shown in the charts, compared to 2 default step learnin rate decay policies, they enacted several SGDR policies with different T_0 and T_mul. T_0 refers to the epoch interval of the first \"mini-run\" and the epoch interval is multiplied by T_mul after each restart. As a result, at the ith \"mini-run\", T_i = T_0*T_mul^(i) And they suggests a SGDR policy with a small T0 = 1 or 10 at start, and set Tmult = 2 to double the epoch interval after every restart. And they claim by this policy, at least 2× to 4× fewer epochs are required to achieve a comparable result than before. ##### CLR A similar method called cyclical Learning rates(CLR) is proposed later by Leslie N. Smith, where 2 kinds of triangular and exponential CLR policies are demonstrated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with most kinds of mainstream CNN modules. Similarly, compared with a default fixed learnin rate, the demonstrats that their policies outperforms in accuracy and efficiency on several datasetes. one obtains the same test classification accuracy of 81.4% after only 25, 000 iterations with the triangular2 policy as obtained by running the standard hyper-parameter settings for 70, 000 iterations. ##### explanation Because of the nonconvexity, it is common sense that reaching a global minima is impossible. With a standard learning rate decay, a saddle point, or unstable local minima is more likely to trap the descending process as shown below. But cyclical Learning rates(CLR) and stochastic gradient descent with warm restarts(SGDR) would allow the process to “jump” from one local minimum to another regularly until a stable one. Still there are several choices, but Cosine Cyclical and Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts are more common. #### learning rate warmup Learning rate warmup is first applied in the famous Resnet paper in one of its experiments. In this case, we find that the initial learning rate of 0.1 is slightly too large to start converging5 . So we use 0.01 to warm up the training until the training error is below 80% (about 400 iterations), and then go back to 0.1 and continue training. And later Goyal and He's work makes a major influence, where constant and gradual methods of warmup are discussed. And gradual warmup is proved to be effective on large minibatch size. As we discussed, for large minibatches (e.g., 8k) the linear scaling rule breaks down when the network is changing rapidly, which commonly occurs in early stages of training. We find that this issue can be alleviated by a properly designed warmup [16], namely, a strategy of using less aggressive learning rates at the start of training. In practice, warmup are always combined with other learning rate methods afterwards. And linear warmup is a default method. #### Reducing the learning rate on plateau Apart from methods scheduling the learning rate with epoch, a dynamic learning rate decay method is also an option. It denotes the process of decaying the learning rate only when the optimizer fails to improve the accuracy or decrease the loss in serval epochs. For example, in AlexNet, The heuristic which we followed was to divide the learning rate by 10 when the validation error rate stopped improving with the current learning rate. The learning rate was initialized at 0.01 and reduced three times prior to termination. In Resnet after the warm-up, The learning rate starts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus Apply learning rate scheduling in PyTorch torch.optim.lr_scheduler provides several methods to adjust the learning rate based on the number of epochs. For example, def train_ch6(net, train_iter, test_iter, num_epochs, lr, device): print(&#x27;training on&#x27;, device) net.to(device) optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=lr) scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, num_epochs*len(train_iter)/10, eta_min=1e-9) loss = LSR(0.1) for epoch in range(num_epochs): net.train() for i, (X, y) in enumerate(train_iter): X, y = X.to(device), y.to(device) optimizer.zero_grad() y_hat = net(X) l = loss(y_hat, y) l.backward() optimizer.step() scheduler.step() Apart from well defined lr_scheduler , torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR allow us to apply self define scheduler such as: print(&#x27;training on&#x27;, device) net.to(device) optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=lr) t=10*len(train_iter)#warmup T=num_epochs*len(train_iter) lambda1 = lambda epoch: (0.9*epoch / t+0.1) if epoch &lt; t else 0.1 if 0.5 * (1+math.cos(math.pi*(epoch - t)/(T-t)))&lt;0.1 else 0.5 * (1+math.cos(math.pi*(epoch - t)/(T-t))) scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda=lambda1) # plot learningrate_decay lr_plot = [] for _i in range(num_epochs): for _j in range(len(train_iter)): optimizer.step() lr_plot.append(optimizer.param_groups[0][&quot;lr&quot;]) scheduler.step() plt.plot(lr_plot) Should we do scheduling with adaptive learning rate method? From Should we do learning rate decay for adam optimizer?, I found it as a arguable question. It depends. ADAM updates any parameter with an individual learning rate. This means that every parameter in the network has a specific learning rate associated. But* the single learning rate for each parameter is computed using lambda (the initial learning rate) as an upper limit. This means that every single learning rate can vary from 0 (no update) to lambda (maximum update). It's true, that the learning rates adapt themselves during training steps, but if you want to be sure that every update step doesn't exceed lambda you can than lower lambda using exponential decay or whatever. It can help to reduce loss during the latest step of training, when the computed loss with the previously associated lambda parameter has stopped to decrease. In my experience it usually not necessary to do learning rate decay with Adam optimizer. The theory is that Adam already handles learning rate optimization (check reference) : \"We propose Adam, a method for efficient stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients with little memory requirement. The method computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients; the name Adam is derived from adaptive moment estimation.\" As with any deep learning problem YMMV, one size does not fit all, you should try different approaches and see what works for you, etc. etc. Yes, absolutely. From my own experience, it's very useful to Adam with learning rate decay. Without decay, you have to set a very small learning rate so the loss won't begin to diverge after decrease to a point. But in the article Decoupled weight decay regularization(AdamW), it is encouraged. Adam can substantially benefit from a scheduled learning rate multiplier. The fact that Adam is an adaptive gradient algorithm and as such adapts the learning rate for each parameter does not rule out the possibility to substantially improve its performance by using a global learning rate multiplier, scheduled, e.g., by cosine annealing. In the CLR article, the authors encourage the combination of CLR methods with Adam as well. Adaptive learning rates are fundamentally different from CLR policies, and CLR can be combined with adaptive learning rates, as shown in Section 4.1. I All in all, theoretically, the adaptive learning rate methods such as Adam adjust the learning rate for each parameters under a upper limit as the global learning rate, which can be adjusted by scheduling. In practice, at least SGDR and CLR have been proved to be useful combining with optimizers. Experiment: Adam vs Adam + SGDR In this little experiment, the best setting in the last article is set as baseline, with Adam with constant learning rate. Leave other settings, Adam with cosine annealing learning rate, and AdamW with cosine annealing learning rate are compared. global learning rate = 0.005 scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts(optimizer, T_0 = **int**(num_epochs***len**(train_iter)/10), T_mult=1, eta_min=1e-9) As shown in the line charts, SGDR lift both the training and test accuracies. And the overfitting of the baseline method is alleviated as well. In the second and sub-figure, the fluctuation in the process of gradient descend caused by the cosine learning rate is obvious. And after each learning rate restart, the rate of the descend also gets a restart. And it takes fewer epochs than to get the same accuracy than the baseline. Reference Kingma, D. P., &amp; Ba, J.

It can always gain some extra points on the image classification tasks. In this article, I have put together useful information from theory to implementation of it. Recently, I joined a Kaggle image classification competition, I used the pretrained ResNet50 plus other tricks and here is to record some of them I've learned for now. Introduction: from hard label to soft label In deep learning, the neural network is basically a super powerful non-linear regression machine aimed to fit a function between the input and the label. And the result is always called label. Hard label, in another word: the one-hot vector, is the most commonly type of label that is used. For example, in this Kaggle image classification competition, to digitalize the different name of the leaves, it is intuitive to encode the leaves categories as: 0, 1, 2, 3. And the factorized target labels would be somehow like [1,3,0...] where each element stands for the categories of the data. With the resulting category dictionary, it can be easily decoded after the training. Actually, there is a slightly difference in the binary world. What usually do is, the previously factorized label will be extended to be a 2-dimensional \"on-hot\" matrix where the elements stands for the probability of each class. And the network is aimed to train itself to make inference label nearest to the target label. Soft label is just slightly deteriorate the strong one-hot label into a weaker one. Simple explanation: How loss function lost information? In the cross entropy loss function, where y_inference and y_grountruth stands for inference and target label, n stands for the number of class. With the one-hot label, the components are 0 except for the true category. In a other word, the y_inference of the wrong category is not considered at all i.e. the information of the wrong category is lost. Which is against the real word classification. Effectiveness: Visualization In When does label smoothing help? Hinton shows the feature map difference between without and with LSR: When label smoothing is applied, the clusters are much tighter because label smoothing encourages that each example in the training set is to be equidistant from all other class’s templates. With hard targets, the clusters for semantically similar classes (for example different breed of dogs in ImageNet), are isotropic whereas, with label smoothing, clusters lie in an arc as shown in the third row. If you mix two semantically similar classes with a third semantically different class, the clusters are still much better than the ones obtained with hard targets as shown in the fourth row. Experiment: apply in competition Label smoothing can be easily applied in Tensorflow, but there is no such thing in PyTorch. So overwrite the Cross-entropy loss function with LSR (implemented in 2 ways): class LSR(nn.Module): &quot;&quot;&quot;NLL loss with label smoothing. &quot;&quot;&quot; def __init__(self, smoothing=0.0): &quot;&quot;&quot;Constructor for the LSR module. :param smoothing: label smoothing factor &quot;&quot;&quot; super(LSR, self).__init__() self.confidence = 1.0 - smoothing self.smoothing = smoothing def forward(self, x, target): logprobs = torch.nn.functional.log_softmax(x, dim=-1) nll_loss = -logprobs.gather(dim=-1, index=target.unsqueeze(1)) nll_loss = nll_loss.squeeze(1) smooth_loss = -logprobs.mean(dim=-1) loss = self.confidence * nll_loss + self.smoothing * smooth_loss return loss.mean() loss = LSR(0.1) class LSR2(nn.Module): def __init__(self, e=0.01,reduction=&#x27;mean&#x27;): super().__init__() self.log_softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1) self.e = e self.reduction = reduction def _one_hot(self, labels, classes, value=1): &quot;&quot;&quot; Convert labels to one hot vectors Args: labels: torch tensor in format [label1, label2, label3, ...] classes: int, number of classes value: label value in one hot vector, default to 1 Returns: return one hot format labels in shape [batchsize, classes] &quot;&quot;&quot; #print(&quot;classes&quot;, classes) one_hot = torch.zeros(labels.size(0), classes) # labels and value_added size must match labels = labels.view(labels.size(0), -1) value_added = torch.Tensor(labels.size(0), 1).fill_(value) value_added = value_added.to(labels.device) one_hot = one_hot.to(labels.device) one_hot.scatter_add_(1, labels, value_added) return one_hot def _smooth_label(self, target, length, smooth_factor): &quot;&quot;&quot;convert targets to one-hot format, and smooth them.

Then apply the LSR and run 50 epochs, with learning rate 0.005 and batch size 256, the result turns to be: It is a exciting improvement, but more tricks still in need. Conclusion 3 disadvantaged of the hard label: the relationship between the true label and the others is neglected, tend to be overfitting the model is tend to be over confident i.e. less generalizable more sensitive to label with noise, wrong labeled for example. Several good things about label smoothing: data augmentation by add more information, compensates for the lack of supervisory signals Improves generalizability Improves noise robust lower the feature norm Improves model calibration Bad things about label smoothing: label smoothing can't give real relationship between labels. It simply adds random noise, under fitting might happen under certain scenarios.

I switch to other theme. Preliminary Why personal blog Keeping a technical blog can be a great way of documenting your growth as a developer. This documentation can be particularly useful on a professional level. All software companies want to hire smart, thoughtful, communicative developers who can easily assimilate into a team, and who are ready to both teach and learn Static vs dynamic blog there are 2 types of mainstream personal blog: static and dynamic. Static is recommended considering its simplicity, 0 maintenance and 0 safety worry. Static blog Dynamic blog Price low, 0 cost when the traffic is relatively low High, server is needed, cloud server of high performance is usually very expensive. Features Limited, only third-party services can be used to complete certain \"dynamic\" functions, such as comments Rich, in WordPress for example, basically any kind of plugins can be found. Featuers such as auto-resizing, media players, multiple authors, scheduled posts, user analysis can be easily realize. Speed Fast Slow Maintainance 0 Need to care about the sever Markdown Supported yet it's the only choice not supported Geeky YES No And I also chose static because I'm geeky (poor of money) and results-driven (lazy to spend time on maintaining).

A sitemap tells Google which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files: for example, for pages, when the page was last updated, how often the page is changed, and any alternate language versions of a page. 1.install sitemap plugins $ npm install hexo-generator-sitemap --save $ npm install hexo-generator-baidu-sitemap --save 2.add to the _config.yml in the blog root # hexo sitemap sitemap: path: sitemap.xml baidusitemap: path: baidusitemap.xml 3.Deploy the blog, go to https://daydreamatnight.github.io/sitemap.xml and https://daydreamatnight.github.io/baidusitemap.xml to see if sitemaps are uploaded 4.Go to Google Search Console, in the left panel, click Sitemaps, enter your sitemap URL sitemap.xml Googlebot won't download the sitemap immediately. Give it time. add robots.txt A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests; it is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, block indexing with noindex or password-protect the page. A robots.txt file is used primarily to manage crawler traffic to your site, and usually to keep a file off Google, depending on the file type: User-agent: * Allow: / Allow: /archives/ Allow: /tags/ Allow: /categories/ Allow: /about/ Allow: /guestbook/ Allow: /others/ Disallow: /js/ Disallow: /css/ Disallow: /lib/ Sitemap: https://daydreamatnight.github.io/sitemap.xml Sitemap: https://daydreamatnight.github.io/baidusitemap.xml deploy the blog and wait. check if sitemap is available After uploaded several updates, my sitemap still didn't fetched by google. So I went to check, it turns out my url setting in _config.yml is wrong. So I changed it to be my home url. And check it with URL Inspection Tool. 1.Open google search console, add the url of sitemap in the upper url inspecting box. It's normal it shows URL is not on Google because it shouldn't as a sitemap. 2.click live test to check the availability. It should be available, then just wait. index Bing to this Blog 1.go to Bing webmaster and login 2.connect with google webmaster. index baidu to this Blog(not possibly working) go to the baidu search console , Click 添加网站 and input every thing, do similar thing add sitemap just wait forever, this could take 2000 years, so give up Add copyright statement 1.open file themes/yilia/layout/_partial/article.ejs add before &lt;% if ((theme.reward_type === 2 || (theme.reward_type === 1 &amp;&amp; post.reward)) &amp;&amp; !index)&#123; %&gt; &lt;!-- add copyright statement --&gt; &lt;% if(theme.declare)&#123;%&gt; &lt;%- partial(&#x27;post/declare&#x27;) %&gt; &lt;% &#125; %&gt; &lt;!-- end --&gt; 2.create new file declare.ejs under themes/yilia/layout/_partial/post/ with: &lt;!--add copyright statement https://github.com/JoeyBling/hexo-theme-yilia-plus/commit/c1215e132f6d5621c5fea83d3c4f7ccbcca074a3--&gt; &lt;% var sUrl = url.replace(/index\\.html$/, &#x27;&#x27;); sUrl = /^(http:|https:)\\/\\//.test(sUrl) ?
