## How to read a paper

The method is inspired by [Andrew Ng's lecutre on Stanford](https://youtu.be/733m6qBH-jI) and [Mu Li's online lecutre](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1H44y1t75x)

### Up to 3 passes for one paper:

| Section       | 1st pass          | 2nd pass            | 3rd pass     |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1. Title      | √                 |                     |              |
| 2. Abstruct   | √                 |                     |              |
| 3. Intro      |                   | criticle references |              |
| 4.Method      | key pics & tables | key pics & tables   | how to apply |
| 5. Expriment  | key pics & tables | key pics & tables   | how to do it |
| 6. Conclusion | √                 |                     |              |

**First pass:** title, abstract, conclusion. Take a look at important figures and tables in the Methods and Experiments section. In this way, you can spend less than 15 minutes to understand whether the paper is suitable for your research direction.

**Second pass:** After confirming that the paper is worth reading, you can quickly go through the whole paper. You don’t need to know all the details. You need to understand important figures and tables, know what each part is doing, and circle the relevant literature. If you think the article is too difficult, you can read the cited literature.

**The third pass:** what problem was asked. How to solve this problem. How to apply the experiment. Close the article and recall what each section is about.

### Some rules:  

- Efficient high informative content first then the harder material 
- Skip the parts which do not make sense unless trying to do deep research on it
- The related work part is often unimportant

### Questions that keep in mind:

- what the authors try to accomplish
- what are the key elements of the approach
- what can you use yourself
- what other references do you want to follow
